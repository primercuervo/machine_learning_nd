    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",

    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "Based on this preprocessing done over the data, I would approach the problem with the following algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gaussian Naive Bayes** would be my first choice, because of the assumption of the independence of the features with each other. Additionally, it uses probability theory to give the best possible result when the assumptions are correct which, in this case, we would assume that the features are gaussian distributed.\n",
    "This method was widely used as a spam classificator or to determine the sentiment of a writing, because it is very easy to implement and works wonders on problems with a large number of features.\n",
    "One drawback of this algorithm is that it relies on the independence of the features for the theory to hold. However, as said during the lecture, the algorithm happens to have a good-enough performance even when independence does not hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ensemble Methods** would be my second choice. I was doubting if going for decision trees because of their simplicity, but conglomerating them into random forests can give us a higher performance with not extremely higher effort. This methods allow us to take various repetitions of single algorithms and then the solution is the aggregate of the single results. These methods are used in applications such as object classification or the improvement of Netflix technology, in the . One of the advantages of ensemble methods of being able to be run among various CPUs, by running each different single algorithm in a different core, and thus allowing CPU acceleration, contrary to other linear models, leading to fast learning times. As the ensemble grows, the complexity of the model grows along, which might lead to overfitting and therefore would result in a weakness of such methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SVM** are my third choice, because of what we learnt of its principle: it optimizes linear classification. In the case that the data is fully separable, SVM will provide the best plane that separates the classes and thus the least error in classification. Additionally, with the kernel trick it is possible to tailor the model so that it suits the problem better. SVMs are used in text categorization and classification, as well as object recognition. SVMs also show to be rather slow than other algorithms, which represents a weakness, above all, in real-time applications. Additionally, they do not have optimal performance in multi-class classification problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "**RESUBMISSION NOTE:** from the first submission I had a mistake that showed that SVMs are not suitable for this dataset analysis when only 1% of the data is being taken into consideration. In this resubmission I will replace the SVM for another implementation: I will take another algorithm from the ensemble bag and use the Adaboost as a replacement. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adaboost**, works similar to Random Forests, by having a multiple small algorithms, such as decision trees,  so-called *weak learners* work repeatedly on subsets of the full data set. The final result is obtained by a combination of the results of the weak learners by the mean of a weighted majority sum. This type of implementation has been used in [face and body recognition of basketball players](https://www.uni-obuda.hu/journal/Markoski_Ivankovic_Ratgeber_Pecev_Glusac_57.pdf) as an specific and intriguing example of object recognition. This method shows to give good results with less tweaking of its parameters, but it is also very prompt to fail when the data is noisy, or there are very noticeable outliers. "

    "**Answer: **Based on the results gotten in the last section, I would suggest that we use the Random Forest Classifier for this problem. From the analyzed methods, the random forest achieved the highest accuracy when compared with the other methods. In regard of the F-Score, it has also the best score when the whole data set is used, only being surpassed by the SVC when the model is fit to the 10% of the whole data set. \n",

Additionally, it takes considerably more time for training and predicting, although that should not be an issue in this specific problem, as it does not require real-time predictions."

In order to understand it, let us first briefly describe what a decision tree is: it is a series of *yes/no* questions related to the information that we have from the recorded data. These questions then determine if any data point corresponds to an income greater than or smaller than $50.000. \n",

For each iteration, Adaboost sees how accurate each of the weak learners is, and keeps track of the best performant. For the next iteration, each of the data points that was classified incorrectly is given a higher weight, in order for it to have greater chances of being taken into account and so tweaking the learners into correctness, without focusing needlessly in the points that it already classifies with confidence. \n",

    "**Answer:** They slightly different, but that might be due the fact that I let myself get distracted with the various cells equal to zero in capital-loss and capital-gain. I also missed the \"age\" feature, because I made a relationship in my head that normally more educated people tend to be older because of the training time they took. I'm surprised that \"occupation\" is not one of the top, but that might be influenced by the market. Additionally, I still can't really understand how the marital status affects the income. Probably a married person seeks high-salary jobs because of increase on responsibilities. \n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

It doesn't help to get the answer fast if it is wrong. If performance can be ensured, then I would definitely consider feature selection as part of my learning process.\n",
